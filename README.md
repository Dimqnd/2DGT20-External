## Description
For the final project of our digital technology class, we were tasked with identifying and solving a real world problem.
As my task, I undertook creating an automatic rostering system for the Department of Health in our government.
I chose this topic due to my knowledge as to how nurses are rostered on wards, in addition to the struggle that it becomes when team members are tasked away from their regular duties and instead placed with the role of creating the roster.
Hence, the solution created works to alleviate having to assign humans to the rostering program and is instead an algorithm to perfectly roster nurses depending on their preferences, work hours and qualifications.

## Brief overview
 - Project for a digital technologies course
 - Written in Python, with the use of .xlm and .json files
 - Includes a GUI, written with the libraries of tkinter
 - Algorithms that automatically unpack data from a json and find the best way to roster a handful of staff
