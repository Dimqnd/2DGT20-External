## Description
For the final project of our digital technology class, we were tasked with identifying and solving a real world problem.
As my task, I originally intended to design a project for the NTG Department of Health, to automatically roster their staff.
Unfortunately, during the scoping phase I identified that this project would be extremely too large for the allocated time frame.
Instead, I am designing an automatic matchmaking system. It takes into account the weight and age of Judoka, and automatically assigns each of them to fights.
I chose this issue as my second issue because of how difficult it is to manually assign fights for our monthly competitions, ran by volunteers.
If I can automate this process, or at least make it easier, I can facilitate more efficient competitions.
I believe I am eligible to design a project of a similar magnitude to this due to my experience in both competitive judo and as a judo referee.
